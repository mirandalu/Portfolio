          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>The current cloud storage marketplace is packed with a wide variety of applications. However, users have encountered various challenges with the cloud storage services such as cluttered design, complex interface, and storage limitations.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Results from user research, discovery and competitive analysis showed that Easebox is the solution that places an emphasis on a simple, easy-to-use interface.  Users are given the tools to create document,  organize files,  collaborate in real-time as well as access everything across all devices, making their workflow more streamlined and efficient.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>I began my research by creating a user survey and distributed it to multiple social media platforms. I wanted to gain a better understanding of how potential users were using cloud storage services, as well as what they did and did not like about using these services.</p>

          <h2>Usability Tests</h2>
          <p>With the digital wireframes completed, I was able to conduct both remote and in-person user testing. To validate general user flows, I asked participants to complete the following tasks:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Sign up for a new account</li>
            <li>2. Create a new content</li>

          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>While the participants were able to complete most tasks successfully, I learned through observations that various elements needed to be addressed on the dashboard.</p>
          <br>
          <h6>Here were my top findings</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Buttons placement was a concern for action clarity and accessibility</li>
            <li>Users wanted to see files that are shared with other users</li>
            <li>Users wanted a search box on the dashboard</li>
            <li>Users suggested adding a dark overlay to selected items</li>
            <li>Users assumed a “drag and drop” option for adding a file into a folder</li>

I started with a mind mapping exercise to capture the brand value and gather ideas through word association.  The entire brand was built with simplicity and the ease of service in mind.  Hence the name Easebox suited the product.</p>

          <p>Navigating through my first project was an invaluable journey for me. I gained more insights on user research and testing to better back up my design decisions in explaining my mockups. Additionally, I learned the importance of thinking about the end users in every step of the way and maintaining feedback loops throughout the design process. In considering further development, I would like to dig deeper into how users would like to use Easebox by conducting more thorough user interviews and contextual inquiry.</p>
